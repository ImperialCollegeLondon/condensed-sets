# An equalizer lemma.

In category theory, if f and g are morphisms from X to Y, then
the equalizer of (f,g) is isomorphic to the equalizer of (g,f).

/- I will assume people know the mathematics of equalizers and limits.

## General category-theory set-up:

The abstract small category with two objects and two morphisms

       left
      ----->   
zero          one
      ----->
      right

is called `walking_parallel_pair` and there is an API which means
that you often don't have to use these names explicitly. Let's just call it J.

Say A and B are two objects of a category ùíû which has equalizers.
Say f and g are two morphisms from A to B. The functor from the `walking_parallel_pair`
category `J` to ùíû sending `zero` to `A`, `one` to `B`, `left` to `f` and `right` to `g` is
called `parallel_pair f g`. We think of this functor as a diagram in the category:

   f   
  ---> 
A      B
  --->  
   g

A term of type `fork f g` is a cone for this diagram, i.e. an object X and
maps X -> A and X -> B making the triangles involving f and g commute.
Note however that this package of data (the maps and the proofs that the
diagrams commute) packaged up as a natural transformation œÄ from the
constant functor J -> ùíû to the `parallel_pair F G` functor (recall that a natural
transformation between two functors J ‚•§ C is a morphism in C for each object in J,
and a proof that a diagram commutes for each morphism in J). 

Note that the fork is determined by the map Œπ : X -> A.

## How to work with the limits. 

The limit data itself (the object and the cone and the proof that the
cone satisfies a universal property) is obtained by type class inference.
User access to the limit data is via an API.

The limit object is `equalizer f g`.

The map from this object to A is `equalizer.Œπ f g` .

The universal property is given by equalizer.lift
